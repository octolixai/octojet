# Recipe book

Each family page describes its supported checkpoint, kernels and operating limits.

Contributor guides cover [adding an MLX family](adding-a-family.md),
[adding a CUDA family](adding-a-cuda-family.md) and [CUDA implementation rules](cuda.md).
[EXL3 weights](exl3.md) and [universal EXL3 experts](exl3-universal-experts.md) describe the shared EXL3
module every CUDA family can read: any codebook, any width per tensor, one grouped launch per MoE projection.

## The contract

Drafted output must equal the same engine's serial output. A resumed prompt must equal that prompt served
fresh, and every concurrent stream must equal its solo run. This contract applies within the same weights,
runtime and settings; another backend or quantization can have different arithmetic.

The sampler keys each draw by seed, absolute position and token ID. A draft is accepted only when it
matches that draw from the target. Each verify row must use the serial row's arithmetic, including
attention boundaries, routing ties and recurrence updates. Rollback must restore all state after the
accepted path, including draft-head state.

Prompt reuse is equally strict. The MLX planner computes chunks from rendered tokens and caches only
compatible boundaries. Its resume points are assistant-message starts and the second message start
when the tokenizer exposes those markers. Chunks skip resume points less than 256 tokens from the
previous start and otherwise end at the first eligible point or after 2,048 tokens. Without recognized
markers, chunks use the 2,048-token grid. Rewriting earlier template text can invalidate reuse.
The chunk scheme and kernel/runtime identity must match before a stored prefix can be reused.

## Measurements

`tools/bench_openai.py` contains public fixtures: a raw Fibonacci-function prompt and a chat prompt asking
how matrix multiplication uses a GPU. The chat fixture disables thinking. After starting a server with
`--name bench`, run from the repository root:

```bash
python3 tools/bench_openai.py http://127.0.0.1:8080 bench \
  --tokens 64 --reps 5 --temperatures 1.0,0 --output bench.json
```

The client warms each cell, uses seeds 1234 through 1238, and reports the median decode rate after the
first token. Sampled cells use temperature 1, top-k 20 and top-p 0.95. The client sends `ignore_eos: true`;
MLX and GLM CUDA honor it, while the Qwen CUDA engines can stop at EOS before the requested limit.
It measures throughput; it does not itself prove token equality. Record checkpoint and tokenizer revisions,
runtime versions, backend, rank count, launch command and output hashes with a result. Compare serial and drafted output separately.

For concurrent MLX workloads, use `tools/bench_concurrent.py` with `--alone --serial` to compare each
concurrent reply with a solo run and check those solo runs against `draft: false`. Long-context and memory
measurements also need a public prompt fixture and its exact rendered-token count. Separate cold, resumed
and post-restart requests.

All 0.3.5 decode, prefill, concurrency and peak-memory results are TBD [release-0.3.5]. Older public-fixture
results in the CUDA family pages are historical measurements, not release qualification.

## Kernel checks

Use exact equality for serial versus multi-row kernels and committed caches. Use a separate trusted
forward for model-quality checks; agreement with one's own serial implementation does not establish
model fidelity. Include real head dimensions, sparse-attention boundaries, partial keeps and concurrent
streams at different lengths. After changing a kernel or runtime, regenerate serial references.

Measure dependent operations and complete requests. Independent microbenchmarks can hide launch cost,
weight-cache effects and lost overlap with other work.
