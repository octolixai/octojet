# Gemma 4 26B-A4B (`gemma4`)

Measured on an M4 Pro with 64 GB (273 GB/s) and MLX 0.31.2, with `mlx-community/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it-4bit`.
Packages: `src/tensorfold/families/gemma4/` and `src/tensorfold/kernels/gemma/v1/`.

## What decides the speed

- 30 layers: 25 sliding-window attention (window 1,024; 16 query heads over 8 KV heads, head dim 256) and 5
  full attention (16 query heads over 2 KV heads, head dim 512, keys reused as values, proportional RoPE).
  Hidden size 2,816.
- Every layer has a dense GeGLU MLP (width 2,112) and a MoE block beside it: 128 experts, top 8, expert width
  704, GeGLU. Three post-feedforward norms and a per-layer scalar join them.
- Vocabulary 262,144, tied to the embedding, logits soft-capped at 30. 4-bit affine weights in groups of 64.
- A token reads about 2.16 GB of weights: 7.9 ms at 273 GB/s. The vocabulary head alone is 415 MB (1.5 ms).
- mlx_lm's step runs about 40 small kernels a layer around the matmuls and takes 14.6 ms synchronous, 13.3
  ms decoded one step ahead.

## Drafts

The checkpoint has no draft head, so a stream drafts copies of its context. With `--drafter
z-lab/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-DFlash --drafter-bits 8` (Apache-2.0; `octojet pull` it first), z-lab's DFlash model
drafts a chain of up to 15 tokens a round. It reads the target's hidden rows after layers 1, 6, 11, 17, 22 and 27,
and the engine sets each round's depth from its costs. Replies stay equal to `"draft": false` ones.

Measured on an M3 Ultra (MLX 0.32.2, quick cells, 64 and 256 tokens, thinking off, gemma/mlx_lm's server):

| Cell | No draft model | DFlash |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chat, greedy | 1.31-1.35 | 1.52-1.53 |
| Chat, sampled | 1.12-1.16 | 1.29-1.31 |
| Code, greedy | 1.31-1.35 | 2.03-2.12 |
| Code, sampled | 1.10-1.16 | 1.62-1.84 |

Rounds average 3-5 rows at 13-20 ms, and the draft takes about 4 ms of that. The draft model runs once per stream
in a round, so four streams sharing rounds make 173-179 tok/s together against 196 without it.

## What worked

One-row steps, greedy, median ms a step on a chat prompt (`tools/gemma4_decode_bench.py` for synchronous,
one step ahead as the server's pipelined engine runs it):

| Step | Synchronous | One step ahead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mlx_lm model | 14.62 (68.4 tok/s) | 13.34 (75.0 tok/s) |
| fused glue only (norms, residuals, routing, stacked q/k/v and dense gate/up) | about 14.0 | |
| plus the expert kernels | 12.65 (79.1 tok/s) | 12.34 (81.0 tok/s) |
| plus the expert down loads issued before the reductions | 12.7 | 12.3-12.5 (80-81 tok/s) |
| plus every load of `attn_tail` and `moe_tail` issued before their first reduction | | 11.7-11.9 (84-85 tok/s) |

Through the server (`TF_GEMMA4_PIPELINE=1`, `tools/bench_openai.py`, 512 tokens, 5 reps, back to back on the
same machine), median tok/s:

| Prompt | Temperature | mlx_lm forward (`TF_GEMMA4_FUSED=0`) | fused, first cut | fused, tails fixed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fibonacci-raw | 0 | 70.0 | 76.3 | 81.3 |
| gpu-chat-no-think | 0 | 70.0 | 76.2 | 80.2 |
| fibonacci-raw | 1.0 | 61.8 | 77.5 | |
| gpu-chat-no-think | 1.0 | 69.3 | 75.2 | |

The server runs about 0.6 ms a token slower than a short in-process loop: back-to-back requests keep the GPU
hot (12.05 ms rested against 12.64 ms after a 2,500-token run, same short context), and the step grows with
context (12.6 to 14.3 ms over 2,500 tokens, the sliding-window caches filling to 1,024 keys).

The pieces (`kernels/gemma/v1/kernels.py`), per layer:

- q, k (and v on sliding layers) stacked into one quantized matmul; `qkv_norm` applies the three head norms
  in one kernel. RoPE, the cache update and attention stay mlx_lm's.
- `attn_tail`: post-attention norm, residual add, and the three norms that read the result (dense MLP input,
  expert input, router input) in one kernel.
- The dense MLP's gate and up stacked into one matmul.
- `route`: router logits to the top 8 of 128 (ties to the lower id), softmax over the 8, per-expert scale.
- `expert_gateup`: the 8 experts' gate and up projections and GeGLU in one pass over the input. MLX's gathered
  matmuls read the input once a projection and launch the activation apart.
- `expert_down`: the 8 experts' down projections and their weighted sum.
- `moe_tail`: post-feedforward norms 1 and 2, the joint norm, residual add, layer scalar, and the next layer's
  input norm.
- The work before and after attention compiled with `mx.compile` per layer; the graph goes to the GPU every 8
  layers.

The glue alone saved about 4%: mlx_lm's glue kernels were cheap next to its gathered expert matmuls, which
read the input once a projection. Stubbing parts of the step showed the experts at 4.2 ms of 13.1 before
the expert kernels.

## Where the time goes now

Each op timed over all 30 layers in one chain (each layer's weights read once, as a real step reads them),
best of five:

| Op | ms a token | MB | GB/s |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| q/k/v (MLX quantized matmul) | 1.72 | 397 | 220-234 |
| o_proj | 1.0 | 227 | 228 |
| dense gate/up + down | 1.45 | 301 | 195-215 |
| expert gate/up + GeGLU | 2.5 | 535 | 210-215 |
| expert down + sum | 1.37 | 268 | 196 |
| head (in the step, with soft-cap and sampling input) | 2.0 | 415 | |

The most this machine read in our runs was 254 GB/s (the head), so the practical floor is about 8.5 ms.

Those rates are for independent calls, which overlap. The step is a dependent chain of about 10 kernels a
layer, so what counts is each kernel's latency in that chain. Removing parts from the real step (medians of
three interleaved rounds, 11.86 ms whole): the head is 1.74 ms, RoPE, the cache update and attention together
0.2 ms, so the 30 layers take about 10.1 ms for 1.74 GB, 173 GB/s. Each matmul reads only 7 to 27 MB a layer,
and its ramp-up and drain sit on the critical path. Dependent-chain latency per call, 30 layers of weights:

| Op | us a call |
| --- | --- |
| trivial elementwise kernel | 9 |
| q/k/v matmul + `qkv_norm` | 93 |
| o_proj | 50 |
| `attn_tail` (before / after issuing loads first) | 54 / 25 |
| router matmul + `route` | 41 to 62 |
| `expert_gateup` | 107 |
| `expert_down` | 80 |
| `moe_tail` (before / after) | 39 / 27 |
| dense MLP (off the critical path, beside routing and experts) | 86 |

## Tried and rejected

- The expert down kernel with every lane busy (704 inputs are 44 chunks of 16, so the committed layout idles
  20 of 32 lanes on the second chunk): 4, 8, 16 or 32 lanes a row. All slower than issuing the 8 rows' loads
  before the reductions, and they change the sum order.
- `expert_gateup` launch shapes (1 to 8 simdgroups, 1 to 8 rows each) and an unrolled K loop: within noise.
- Handing the graph to the GPU every 0, 4, 15 or 30 layers instead of 8: within noise.
- Folding RoPE into `qkv_norm`: removing RoPE from the step saves 0.07 ms, so not attempted.
- The dense MLP as three more expert slots (its width 2,112 is three expert widths; Nemotron folds its shared
  expert the same way): two launches instead of five, correct to bf16, but 12.39 to 12.56 ms. The dense MLP
  used to run beside routing; merged, it waits for the router.
- The 8-bit router matvec and the top-8 selection in one threadgroup: same experts and bit-identical weights
  in 600 of 600 checks, 62 to 46 us in a dependent chain, but 11.69 to 12.13 ms in the step. MLX's matvec
  spreads over the GPU beside the dense MLP; one threadgroup does not.
- `qkv_norm` with its norm weights loaded before the reduction: no change (many threadgroups hide the latency).
- `MLX_MAX_OPS_PER_BUFFER=200` and `MLX_MAX_MB_PER_BUFFER=100000` (Nemotron's and Flash Next's settings):
  within noise.

## Exactness

- One-token steps run the fused kernels; prompts run mlx_lm's forward and fill the same caches. The fused
  arithmetic follows mlx_lm's (fp32 sums, bf16 where mlx_lm stores bf16) with its own sum orders (strategy C
  in the [recipe book](README.md)), so serial decoding through it is its own reference.
- The family does not draft: without `multi_row_exact` the engine runs one row a round. The same limit as
  Flash Next and Nemotron applies to prompts: a one-token suffix after a cache hit goes through the fused
  step, a longer one through mlx_lm's forward.
- Quality, judged against the same 4-bit weights run with fp32 activations (`tools/gemma4_truth_eval.py`), on
  5,742 tokens of the model's own sampled answers to 12 chat prompts:

| Path | KL mean | KL trimmed | KL median | tokens over 1 nat | top-1 = truth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| mlx_lm whole-sequence forward | 0.00297 | 0.00228 | 3.6e-6 | 0 | 98.89% |
| mlx_lm decode | 0.00329 | 0.00251 | 4.1e-6 | 0 | 98.61% |
| fused decode | 0.00893 | 0.00245 | 4.0e-6 | 2 | 98.66% |

  The fused mean comes from 2 tokens of 5,742, knife-edge positions where any bf16 rounding flips the answer.
  At one of them every bf16 path disagrees with the fp32 one. At the other, each of the 354 x 30 expert-down
  calls matches mlx_lm within bf16 on identical inputs.
- Tests (`tests/test_gemma4_kernels.py`): every kernel against an MLX reference, each layer against mlx_lm's
  layer on identical inputs with a small quantized model, and the caches advancing as mlx_lm's do.

## Traps

- KL or NLL against mlx_lm's own samples charges any difference from mlx_lm as damage: it called this path 4x
  worse. Compare every path against an fp32 truth, and read the trimmed and median figures beside the mean.
- A chat model's NLL on raw text or on chat templates is 7 to 10 nats a token. The distribution there is too
  flat to rank kernels. Score the model's own answers.
- Timing a kernel by calling it repeatedly on one layer's weights reads them from cache: 402 GB/s on a 273
  GB/s machine. Chain through all layers.
- Single timing runs of the step drifted up to 7% between runs (12.3 to 13.2 ms). Decide with interleaved A/B
  runs in one process and identical output hashes.
- A kernel's latency in an isolated dependent chain did not predict the step twice: the merged dense MLP and
  the one-threadgroup router both won alone and lost in the step, where they gave up overlap with other work.
- The server rebuilds saved system blocks after a kernel change. A request that arrives during that rebuild
  waits (11.8 s behind a 25k-token block here), which looks like a slow first token.

## Next

- The layers read 1.74 GB at 173 GB/s against about 245 possible, 2.9 ms a token. The loss is latency in the
  per-layer chain, so it needs fewer dependent kernels a layer (one kernel per matmul and its tail, or a
  persistent kernel over the layer), not faster matvecs.
- `expert_gateup` from about 215 toward 240 GB/s is worth about 0.3 ms a token.
- A multi-row fused step with a load-time row check would allow copy windows (drafting).
- Prefill through the fused step would remove the cache dependence of prompt bits.
